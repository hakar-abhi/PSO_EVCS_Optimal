# PSO_EVCS_Optimal
The Matlab files included in this set facilitate determining the ideal locations for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) by utilizing the PSO algorithm. These files are designed with an objective function focused on minimizing line losses within the system.

The set of Matlab files contains:

i) A script that creates a directed graph for a specific bus system using provided bus data, line data, and switch status.

ii) Programs for conducting backward/forward sweeps to compute line losses. This is applicable not only to the IEEE 33 bus system but also for other test cases, given the accurate input.

iii) An algorithm executed through Matlab utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to determine the optimal placement of EV charging stations. These stations are positioned on buses to minimize line losses in the system.
